So you want to run this thing?  We use Grunt (http://gruntjs.com/) for build steps, so you need to install Grunt, and then run:

- grunt server

Then you can load the index.html, etc. from /dist/.  Loading index.html from /app/ will NOT WORK!!

You get the following with Grunt
- Live Reload
- Auto-Prefixing (i.e. display: flex; will be old and new flexbox standards AND get vendor prefixed)
- Loads of other cool and useful stuff.... ;)
